Pog is a modern MVC style framework built on top of [io.js](http://iojs.org) and [koa](http://koajs.com). It's built to be fast, simple and easy to configure, with sane defaults and flexible boilerplates to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

It's a work in progress, check back often for updates.

Full documentation will be coming soon.


#### DEPENDENCIES
Pog takes advatage of the latest ES6 updates, and requies either io.js or node.js 0.12+ with the --harmony flag.


#### INSTALL COMMAND LINE TOOL

```
$ npm install pog -g
```


#### CREATE A NEW APP

```
$ pog
```

This will ask you a few questions to help customize your app, and then you'll be all set.


#### START THE SERVER

Assuming you have io.js installed

```
$ gulp start
```

or

```
$ iojs server.js
```

or if you prefer to stick with node and have at least version 0.12 installed:

```
$ node --harmony server.js
```
